Certainly! Let's add documentation for the frontend side (React)
 to your Django project documentation.

### 6. Frontend (React)

#### 6.1 Livestream Page

The frontend of the "Livestream Project" is developed using React.
 It provides users with a seamless interface for viewing the livestream and managing overlays.

- **Components:**

  - **App Component (`src/App.js`):**
  
    - Manages the state for the RTSP URL, overlays, and form submission.
    - Utilizes `react-player` for displaying the livestream.
    - Implements a form for adding new overlays.

- **Styled Components:**

  - Custom styled components are used to enhance the visual appeal
   of the application.

- **Interaction Flow:**

  - Users can input the RTSP URL and click "Play" to start the livestream.
  - The livestream player is displayed, and users can see the current overlays.
  - Users can add new overlays through the form, providing content, position, and size.
  - Added overlays are dynamically updated on the page.

- **Dependencies:**

  - `react-player`: Used for embedding and controlling the livestream player.
  - `styled-components`: Utilized for styling React components.
